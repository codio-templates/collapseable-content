# Adding a Markdown Code Block to a `<details>` Tag

In order to add a code block with markdown syntax to a `<details>` tag, the tag needs to be wrapped in a `<table>` tag. I do not know why this is, but adding a markdown code block to a `<details>` will not render as expected. This project (page 1 of the Guide) is an example that you can copy/paste from to use in your own work.
